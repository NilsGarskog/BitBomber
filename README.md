Repo for course in userprogramming II at UU

Project name: BitBomber

Project members: Nils Gärskog, Isak Lindström, Simon Olofsson, Samuel Ram, Hugo Asztély

Short description: A four player local multiplayer game inspired by bomberman. Be the last person standing in a short game where you use bombs to blow upp stuff and gather loot to win over your friends.

Plattform: A game compatiable with PC and Mac depending on the type of executable file, both .exe and .app exists. Made with Unity.

How to run: We will provide both an .exe file that can be excecuted with any PC and this repository. To run this repo you need to have Unity version 2022.3.22f1 and Unity hub installed. You later import the whole repo into unity hub and launch Unity through the hub. To see the code / scripts, look in folders Assets -> Scripts.

Problems / diffuculties with Unity: The biggest problem was the sync with Unity and Github when working five people simultaneously. When working in the same scene in unity it created merge errors. We solved this with rules and communications, only one branch / person worked at the same scene at the same time.
